As you can see, some options are still missing. I have added the basic (and most used) ones.
Please feel free to send me patches if you miss some extra options.

The license is `WTFPL` so you're allowed to do whatever you want with the code. It's provided
as-is, and I'm not responsible for any damage or data loss.

Build
=====

You'll need `Qt 5.x` and `cmake`, or `QtCreator`.
There is nothing special about the code; just open the project and hit the build button.
